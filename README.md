## FAQs

1. Why is Markdown better than a word processor?
- Markdown is better because it is easy to convert to markup language like HTML (the language of World Wide Web) as compared to MS word which is most commonly used word processor. It is much easier and faster to learn than HTML. In addition, Markdown-formatted text also works really well with foratting content displayed through dynamic websites. It also converts tomany other different file types without losing much of the formatting, unlike word processors.

2. Why is my resume not showing up?
- If your resume is not showing up, it might be because usually it takes some time for GitHub Pages to update so probably check after 15 to 20 minutes or an hour of creating the file or making changes to it.
